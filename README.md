# onetomanymapping
In this i am going to write the code for one to many mapping using Spring boot jpa.
the best way to model a one-to-many relationship is to use just @ManyToOne annotation on the child entity.

The second best way is to define a bidirectional association with a @OneToMany annotation on the parent side of the relationship and a @ManyToOne annotation on the child side of the relationship

This is known as Bidirectional Mapping It has some Pros and Cons.

In this section, weâ€™ll define the domain models of our application - Post and Comment.
 
 created_at and updated_at comes automatically while using jpa.
 
 difference between one to one and onetomany is that in onetoone it is not possible to have a bidirectional relationship.
